Creating a Jar file
A java package is a group of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. They may be in different folders.

Syntax
jar [OPTION ...] [ [--release VERSION] [-C dir] files]

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/specs/man/jar.html

-c Creates the archive.
-i=FILE Generates index information
-t Lists the contents of Jar
-u Updates a JAR file
-x Extracts the named (or all) files
-d Prints module name.


1.0 Compile the Java Source
Syntax 
javac [options] [sourcefiles-or-classnames]

https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/specs/man/javac.html


2.0 Put the java source files in sources.txt .

Our package example has following file structure.

JarPack.java
  |-com
     |-shilpasayura
        |-oceangame
           |-Aquarium.java
ocean
 |-plants
    |-Algae.java
    |-Seaweed.java
 |-Fish.java

sources.txt should be like below.

JarPack.java
com\shilpasayura\oceangame\Aquarium.java
ocean\plants\Algae.java
ocean\plants\Seaweed.java
ocean\Fish.java

3.0 Complie the package.

javac @sources.txt

Run Java program

java -cp . JarPack

output :
Fish
Seaweed
Algee
Aquarium

4.0 Creating the Jar file.

The jar command creates Java archive for deployment. 
It takes extension *.jar, but based on ZIP format.

4.1 create manifest.txt file

Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)
Main-Class: JarPack

* make sure extra empty line in manifest.txt

4.2 Create the classes.txt and put all the java class files in it. 

JarPack.class
com\shilpasayura\oceangame\Aquarium.class
ocean\plants\Algae.class
ocean\plants\Seaweed.class
ocean\Fish.class

5.0 compile the package to package.jar

jar cfm package.jar manifest.txt @classes.txt

6.0 List the content of package.jar file

jar -tf package.jar

com/shilpasayura/oceangame/Aquarium.class
JarPack.class
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
ocean/Fish.class
ocean/plants/
ocean/plants/Algae.class
ocean/plants/Seaweed.class

7.0 Run the package.jar file

java -jar package.jar
 
8.0 It runs!
